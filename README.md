Mini game for kids to learn coding rudiments

Click the buttons to compose a sequence of actions in the Story panel and click Play to run your Story.
You can have Mario making decisions about what to do based on the surrounding environment.

Watch out for the correct syntax (i.e., you need to select an action after a while; you need a condition after a while/if; you need to be in an if or a while to put a condition or a negation)!


## Getting started
Well, this is just a static page with logic fully running on client side. Just download and open "game.html" within a browser, that's it!
